            <h2>Background:</h2>
            <p>
                This project seeks to contextualize and visualize the impact of the pandemic on companies in the airline industry and the overall changes in consumer demand. It seeks to do so by analyzing the number of flights and routes over each quarter, which carriers are more common for a certain route, what fares passengers paid, distances travelled for each route, and the overall number of passengers per quarter. It is important to do so because it helps to efficiently communicate and depict complex flight trends over a vast amount of time and how exogenous variables like changes in policies and guidelines can impact the sector. Given that flights are a primary mode of transportation connecting people across vast distances, it is fascinating to observe shifts in human behavior and the domestic response to major disruptions like a pandemic. Additionally, visualizing the recovery of these networks across regions and routes reveals how such events influence macroeconomic trends and reshape domestic interactions.

            <h2>Our Dataset:</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset we will use is the ‘US Airline Flight Routes and Fares 1993 – 2024.’  In this dataset, the features are table identifier, year, quarter, origin city market ID, destination city market ID, origin city, destination city, origin airport ID, destination airport ID, origin airport code, destination airport code, distance between airport, number of passengers, average fare, the largest carrier by passengers, and market share of the largest carrier. This is a large dataset, having 23 columns and 63.04 MB. The dataset we have chosen includes nearly 250,000 rows of data. When dealing with a platform like GitHub, that is simply too much data to parse through. Additionally, we are not concerned with gathering data from 1993-2024, rather we are concerned with data that allows us to view the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. We will take less than 5% of this dataset to focus on the years 2018-2023, parsing the data to include only rows that include those dates. Additionally, we are only looking at flights that departed from Boston. To do this, we removed all rows that did not include a departure from the Boston metropolitan area. We obtained this dataset from Kaggle. The only missing data is some of the geolocation data, which won’t be necessary to use as we have the city names.

            <h2>Tasks:</h2>
            <p>
                Now that we have summarized how we worked with the data, here are some of the steps we took to clean the data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Removed unnecessary columns from the dataset</li>
                    <li>Filtered the data for all years aside from 2018-2023, and deleted these rows</li>
                    <li>Filtered the data for all flights that did not depart from the Boston metropolitan area, and deleted those rows</li>
                    <li>Added an additional column for airline, which used a legend to relate the airline code to their full name</li>
                    <li>Parsed through the dataset, removing "(Metropolitan Area)" which was present after several major cities, so that the cities would populate on our visualizations</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                With the data clean, here is what we were looking to do with the data:
                <ul>
                    <li>Visualize changes in customer demand over time for air travel through trends and variability in fares charged and number of flights</li>
                    <li>Evaluate which airlines have the most amount of passengers and any detectable behaviors in fares charged and market share</li>
                    <li>Create a map showing which destination cities are most popular to visit and evaluate and compare the passenger volume passengers traveling to each city</li>
                    <li>Observe any noticeable trends that COVID-19 might have played out on different variables such as miles traveled, fares charged, passengers on flights, and carrier volumes</li>
                </ul>

                <p>This chart is a map of the United States, highlighting cities and states that had the highest volume of passengers in the years 2018-2023. The scale on the right side represents the volume of passengers that flew on an airline from Boston, MA to a particular state. States like Florida and California have well over 100,000 passengers who have flown into their states from Boston, whereas states like Montana and Kentucky only have a few thousand passengers who flew from Boston in that period. It is important to note that this dataset includes only about a dozen airlines, therefore there may be states or routes that are not included.</p>
                <p>The blue spots on the chart represent hotspots for flights, noting the cities within each state that flights from Boston arrive at. Larger spots are representative of a higher volume of passengers. Looking at the data, it appears that some of the most popular destinations include Orlando, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Washington DC, New York City, and Denver, among others.</p>

                <p>This graph displays the airlines with the most flights in Boston. From the graph, the two airlines, represented as "WN" (Southwest Airlines) and "AA" (American Airlines), dominate the market with the highest number of flights, exceeding the other carriers. "WN" leads with approximately 1,600 flights, closely followed by "AA" with around 1,400 flights. Other carriers, such as "B6" (JetBlue Airways), "DL" (Delta Air Lines), and "UA" (United Airlines), have considerably fewer flights, with numbers ranging from about 400 to 800, indicating they have a notable but not much compared to "WN" or "AA". Several other carriers are also present, such as "AS" (Alaska Airlines), "MX", "NK" (Spirit Airlines), and others, but they contribute little to not to the overall flight volume, each having only a few hundred or fewer flights compared to the leading airlines. The graph illustrates a highly skewed distribution, with the majority of flights concentrated among a few dominant airlines, while the rest operate a small number of flights. This disparity reflects a competitive imbalance, suggesting that a handful of carriers hold a significant market share and likely benefit from higher consumer visibility and brand loyalty, while the smaller airlines might serve specialized routes or have limited operational capacity. The overall pattern highlights a clear disparity in airline operations in Boston, indicating a strong market presence for a few leading carriers while others maintain a minimal role.</p>

    <p>This static visualization is a side-by-side box plot showing flight fare distributions across different airlines faceted to provide a year-over-year comparison from 2018 to 2023. The x-axis represents different airlines (carrier_lg) and the y-axis shows the distribution of median, minimum, maximum, interquartile range, and outliers of flight fares (fare). The chart enables users to observe trends or differences in fare distributions across airlines, analyze how these change over time, and identify airlines with typically higher or lower fares along with their associated outliers. According to the graph, regional and low-cost airlines like Sun County, Avelo, Spirit, and Breeze were introduced to Boston before the pandemic in 2019 and in 2021 and have an overall low range of fares; American Airlines and Southwest typically has the largest range of fares. Overall, most outliers tend to be skewed upward.</p>

<div class="chart-description">
    <p>This interactive visualization explores the relationship between the largest carrier’s market share (large_ms) and associated fare prices (fare_lg) and is faceted by year to represent each year from 2018 to 2023. The x-axis shows the largest carrier’s market share while the y-axis represents the largest carriers’ fare prices. The first interactive element is driven by a radio input that allows users to select a specific destination city from a list of some destination cities included in the dataset. When a certain destination city is selected, the data is filtered to display only carriers and market shares associated with that destination, while the default option (None) shows data for all cities. This makes it easy to visualize and compare trends for a particular city. The second element of interaction comes from Tooltip to provide additional information on airline name, fare price, and market share for each data point that the mouse hovers over. From the visualization, we can understand how the options available influence people’s carrier choice and the cost that they might incur from it. When looking at the entirety of the data, between 2020 and 2021, the data was more clustered and correlated than other years, but overall there is no particular trend in how the points are plotted.</p>

<!-- Chart 5 -->

</div>
<div class="chart-description">
    <p>This interactive visualization shows the relationship between flight distance, passenger count, and fare while also factoring in the number of flights varying across the destination cities. Overall, it describes patterns and trends as to which cities have the highest number of flights in a specific distance and fare range. The chart has two components of a scatter plot and interactive bar chart. In the scatter plot, the x-axis represents distance of the flight in miles (nsmiles) and the y-axis represents the number of passengers on each flight (passengers); the points are colored based on average fare (fare). The interactive aspect and subsequent bar chart comes when the user draws a rectangle over a rane of the scatter plot’s data. The bar chart’s x-axis represents each destination city and its y-axis represents the count of flights to that city. From the scatter plot, we can see a dip in the number of flights between 1,700 and 2,200 miles, most likely due to those cities being located in less populated Midwest cities; in terms of the color, we can see that there is a clear relationship as the fare tends to increase when the number of miles a flight travels also increases.</p>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted flights departing from Boston, showing significant changes in passenger behavior and airline operations from 2018 to 2023. This project focused on trends in passenger volume, airfare, carrier dominance, and route popularity, offering insights into the sudden change and subsequent recovery in the airline industry. Prior to the pandemic, flights to popular destinations like New York, Florida, and California consistently had numerous passengers. However, 2020-2021, there was a sharp decline in travel due to restrictions, with a slow recovery starting in 2022 as travel continued.</p>
            <p>Airfare trends reflected these sudden changes, with fares dropping during the pandemic due to reduced demand and rising again in 2022-2023 as the airline industry recovered as time went on. The study also highlighted how major carriers maintained their dominance in the industry, while smaller airlines faced challenges. Long-distance routes recovered more steadily compared to mid-distance or shorter routes, indicating increased interest in long travel post-pandemic.</p>
            <p>Overall, this project illustrates the ups and downs of the airline industry and provides a deeper understanding of how global events can reshape transportation networks. The findings emphasize the importance of flexibility and adaptation for airlines to navigate and avoid future disruptions and please consumer demands and trends.</p>
